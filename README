This is the E-Blah Template Editor ported to Qt from C# .NET for ease of cross-platform deployment. This port of the E-Blah Template Editor will run on Mac OS X 10.6 or higher, Windows XP SP2 or higher, and Linux GNOME or KDE desktops. No downloads available yet, but hopefully there will be some soon.
